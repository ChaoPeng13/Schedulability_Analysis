II. Description								

This software establishes the accuracy of the results
presented in the paper. The results are presented in a report
that is included in this project.

Also, a survey of real-time hypervisors are presented.

Below are instructions to compile and run the project as
well as detailing some instructions.

-----------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE
-----------------------------------------
Use the makefile to build the project
Please make sure that the linker knows where to find the math library else please make sure you give the correct path to gcc command

Note: Please create a bin folder if not present
-----------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN
-----------------------------------------
Type "bin/Program" at the console

The report is shown after you enter all the tasksets

##################################################################################################################
NOTE: you may have to be the root user if the current folder does not allow normal users to read/write to files.
      This program writes 6 files to the same directory from where it is run

-----------------------------------------
BASIC ERRORS THAT MIGHT BE ENCOUNTERED
-----------------------------------------
If the program crashes please reduce the limit of MAX_* in the header file since it might be the case that the system does not have enough memory.

Also try raising MAX_MEMORY to more than 1000 if the no of tasks is high in number. Since this variable keeps track of the RT,Loading Factor tests,
having its value greater than the no of iterations required for convergence is crucial.
